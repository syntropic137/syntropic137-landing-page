/**
 * Supported agent harnesses.
 *
 * A harness is the coding-agent CLI that executes a workflow phase inside a
 * Syntropic137 workspace. Phases select one per phase via `agent.provider` in
 * the workflow YAML, so a single workflow can mix harnesses and hand work
 * between them.
 *
 * Adding a harness should be an edit to this file, not a copy hunt through
 * components. Hero and AgentControlPlane render their harness lists from
 * HARNESSES, so a new entry appears in both without touching either. Prose that
 * says something specific about ONE harness stays hand-written, because that
 * claim does not generalise.
 *
 * Keep `controlPlane` honest: it is the difference between a claim we can back
 * and one we cannot.
